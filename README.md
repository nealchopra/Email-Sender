Gmail? Yahoo Mail? Outlook? Pfft. Here is a simple email sender that was made using Python. 

You can easily change the subject and the body to whatever message you'd like, then send it to whoever you'd like.

NOTE: To actually get the email credentials (email and password), follow these instructions (only works for Gmail, but you can do the same for other email services): https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en. You want to use the 16-character app password that Google creates for you when you are giving the "email-password" string a value.
